Given an array of unsorted numbers and a target number, find a triplet in the array whose sum is as close to the target number as possible, return the sum of the triplet. 
If there are more than one such triplet, return the sum of the triplet with the smallest sum.

Example 1:

Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]

Input: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 6], target=5
Output: 4
Explanation: There are two triplets with distance '1' from target: [1, 1, 2] & [0,0, 6]. 
Between these two triplets, the correct answer will be [1, 1, 2] as it has a sum '4' which is less than the sum of the other triplet which is '6'. 
This is because of the following requirement: 'If there are more than one such triplet, return the sum of the triplet with the smallest sum.'


def closest_triplet_sum(arr, target):
    arr.sort()
    closest_sum = float('inf')  # Initialize closest_sum to positive infinity.

    for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
        left, right = i + 1, len(arr) - 1

        while left < right:
            current_sum = arr[i] + arr[left] + arr[right]

            if abs(current_sum - target) < abs(closest_sum - target):
                closest_sum = current_sum

            if current_sum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

    return closest_sum

# Example usage:
arr = [-1, 2, 1, -4]
target = 1
result = closest_triplet_sum(arr, target)
print("Closest triplet sum to", target, "is", result)
